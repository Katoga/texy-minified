Texy!
=====
Minied version of [Texy](https://github.com/dg/texy) library made by [David Grudl](http://davidgrudl.com). The minification is his work too (see zip file in [releases](https://github.com/dg/texy/releases)), I've just made it available in a git repository and installable via composer.

    php composer.phar require katoga/texy-minified
